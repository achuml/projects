### Projects

#### Project 1: NFL Head Injuries
<a href="Final_Report_Template.html" title="STOR320 Final Project">Click here to view project</a>

**Class: STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science**

**Project Description** 

This project was a final assignment in STOR 320, a sophmore year statistics class. Within a group of four members, we chose the topic of head injuries in the NFL, and posed several questions we wanted to try and answer. Then throughout the course, we progressively used the skills we learned to bring the data into R, clean it, and manipulate/analyze it in order to answer the questions proposed at the beginning. Finally, we downloaded our findings, information, and process into the html file linked above.

**Skills Used** 

- R coding
- Data Analysis
- Collaborative team building and group work

### Projects

**Class: STOR 515: Dynamic Decision Analytics**

**Project Description** 

This project was a final assignment in STOR 515, a upper level statistics class. Within a group of four members, we chose the topic of modeling an inventory decision for steak at a local restaurant. To begin, we spoke with the managers and learned how the process currently works, along with the quantities normally bought and sold. Then, using the Finite-Horizon Markov Decision Proces, we applied the information we gathered (under some educated assumptions) and derived the most profitable order amounts for the rest of the year. Finally, we compiled all our work and findings into the html file linked above.

**Skills Used** 

- Python Coding
- Data Analysis/Interpretation
- Data Gathering
- Data Cleaning
- Markov Decision Processes
- Collaborative team building and group work
